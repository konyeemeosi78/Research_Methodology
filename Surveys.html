    <h1>Ethical and Professional Implications of Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h1>

    <p>The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 illustrates one of the most significant breaches in ethical digital research and survey practice in recent history. Data were collected through Facebook personality quizzes that ostensibly served academic purposes. However, as noted by Schneble, Elger and Shaw (2018), the information was covertly harvested not only from survey participants but also from their social connections, without their knowledge or informed consent. This data was subsequently exploited for psychographic profiling and targeted political campaigning, amounting to a gross violation of autonomy and privacy. The incident highlights the profound ethical failure of obtaining data under misleading pretences and demonstrates how digital platforms can be manipulated to circumvent the principles of transparency and voluntary participation.</p>

    <p>Hinds, Williams and Joinson (2020) observed that the scandal severely damaged public trust in online research and platform governance. Beyond privacy violations, it introduced concerns about manipulation of democratic processes through targeted misinformation. Although legal repercussions followed, including the reinforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the European Union, the core issue extended beyond legal compliance to the erosion of ethical accountability. The methods used by Cambridge Analytica demonstrated a clear disregard for user autonomy, and the exploitation of psychological insights for political influence further exacerbated the ethical violations.</p>

    <p>A second example involves the misuse of surveys in public health contexts. Schyff, Flowerday and Furnell (2020) examined how digital data collection in health research, particularly regarding vaccination attitudes, has sometimes involved participants being misled about the full scope and purpose of data collection. Researchers may intentionally withhold specific details to reduce bias in participant responses, but this form of deception—however minor it may appear—violates informed consent standards and risks undermining public confidence in health messaging. The ethical concerns extend to possible amplification of the nocebo effect, where participants’ expectations of harm contribute to real or perceived negative outcomes.</p>

    <p>In both cases, there are deep ethical concerns centred on deception, consent, and transparency. The Cambridge Analytica incident involved the deliberate repurposing of personal data for objectives that were never disclosed to participants. Similarly, in health survey misuse, failure to disclose research intent undermines the respect for persons and violates ethical norms regarding voluntary participation.</p>

    <p>Socially, these practices have had damaging effects. As González-Pizarro et al. (2022) noted, public concern about data privacy and digital surveillance increased significantly after the Cambridge Analytica revelations. This concern was not uniform across regions, indicating cultural and contextual differences in expectations of privacy. However, the overall trajectory has been toward greater scepticism of digital surveys and a decline in willingness to engage with online research initiatives.</p>

    <p>Legally, these cases have pushed data protection policies toward more stringent standards. However, legal reform alone does not address the broader erosion of professional and institutional credibility. Professionally, both examples represent a failure of researchers and data managers to uphold their obligations to participants. Ethical frameworks require that researchers not only obtain consent but ensure that it is informed, specific, and freely given. When these criteria are unmet, the legitimacy of the research is fundamentally compromised.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the inappropriate use of surveys in both political and health-related contexts underscores the need for transparent, ethically sound methodologies. Data collection must be rooted in honesty, informed participation, and oversight by ethics committees or institutional review boards. Where digital platforms are used, additional care must be taken to ensure that consent mechanisms are clear, user-friendly, and aligned with ethical best practices. Without these safeguards, the boundary between legitimate research and exploitation becomes dangerously thin.</p>
