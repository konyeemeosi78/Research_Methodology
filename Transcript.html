    <h1>Cloud Security Risks in the Healthcare Sector</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Good morning, good afternoon, good evening everyone, depending on where you are watching from. My name is Onyeemeosi Kingsley Oke, and I’m currently enrolled in the MSc Cyber Security programme at the University of Essex. This presentation is part of my Research Methodology module. Today, I’ll be sharing an overview of my research proposal titled: “Cloud Security Risks in the Healthcare Sector.” This study investigates the unique cybersecurity challenges introduced by cloud computing within healthcare settings.</p>
    <p>Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, revolutionizing data storage, management, and service delivery. With the rise of digitized health records, telemedicine, and interconnected diagnostic tools, cloud services have enabled healthcare institutions to transcend traditional infrastructure limitations. As Almeida & Tavares (2021a) observe, cloud computing has enhanced real-time clinical collaboration and patient-centric care across geographically dispersed systems. Among the various deployment models, hybrid cloud architectures—integrating both public and private cloud infrastructures—have gained prominence. These systems offer flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scalability, while purportedly retaining greater control over sensitive data (Al-Issa, Ottom, and Tamrawi, 2019a).</p>
    <p>However, the benefits of hybrid cloud architectures come with notable cybersecurity challenges. These environments are inherently complex, often characterized by inconsistent access control mechanisms, fragmented monitoring protocols, and heterogeneous device networks, as highlighted by Zhao et al. (2023). Moreover, healthcare data’s sensitivity and black-market value make it a high-value target for cybercriminals. Ferreira et al. (2018) note that breaches, such as the ransomware attack on the UK's National Health Service (NHS), resulted in systemic disruptions, treatment delays, and eroded public trust. These incidents underscore the urgent need to critically examine cloud security risks within the healthcare sector (Angelillo et al., 2023a).</p>
    <p>This study interrogates the specific vulnerabilities introduced by cloud technologies in healthcare and critically assesses current mitigation strategies. It foregrounds the regulatory, operational, and ethical implications of cloud-based data handling and explores the unique challenges posed by clinical workflows, legacy systems, and legal compliance requirements. Through a critical engagement with peer-reviewed literature, this research aims to construct a comprehensive and empirically grounded understanding of cloud security risks in healthcare.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The increasing reliance on digital platforms in healthcare has elevated the importance of secure and reliable information systems. Cloud computing facilitates this by offering on-demand access to computing resources, scalable storage solutions, and cost-effective infrastructure. Yet, its integration into healthcare environments—especially those involving hybrid or multi-cloud deployments—presents significant security challenges. Almeida & Tavares (2021b) affirm that while cloud models support essential functionalities such as EHRs, remote diagnostics, and IoT-based monitoring, they simultaneously increase exposure to external threats and internal misconfigurations.</p>
    <p>Healthcare providers frequently operate under strained IT budgets and rely on legacy systems that are ill-equipped to interface securely with modern cloud services. This tension between innovation and infrastructure inertia exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Ferreira et al. (2018b) detail the case of the WannaCry ransomware attack on the NHS, attributing its success to outdated operating systems, weak authentication mechanisms, and insufficient network segmentation. The incident paralyzed critical services and revealed a widespread lack of cyber preparedness. More recently, the 2021 ransomware attack on Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) disrupted healthcare delivery nationwide and compromised sensitive patient data, highlighting the enduring nature of these threats (Dumka and Sah, 2019a).</p>
    <p>Cloud security threats in healthcare extend beyond ransomware to include insider threats and cloud misconfigurations. As highlighted by Zhao et al. (2023b), IAM failures and insecure APIs in hybrid environments often lead to unauthorized access and data loss. According to Farahani et al. (2020), the growing use of IoT devices, mobile apps, and third-party platforms increases the attack surface. These trends call for adaptable, ethically aware security models. Traditional perimeter defences are inadequate; as observed by Rose et al. (2020), they fail to stop lateral movement after a breach. Furthermore, Angelillo et al. (2023b) note that fragmented logging and inconsistent policies in hybrid clouds make incident detection and response more difficult.</p>

    <h2>Research Problem</h2>
    <p>Despite advancements in cybersecurity, cloud environments in healthcare still experience frequent breaches. These are not just technical failures but reflect deeper systemic problems. As discussed by Kruse et al. (2017), issues like regulatory complexity, fragmented infrastructure, and limited institutional capacity contribute to the challenge. Conventional tools such as firewalls and endpoint protections fall short in addressing the dynamic nature of cloud systems. This research focuses on the complex interplay between technological vulnerabilities, operational challenges, and ethical risks in healthcare cloud security.</p>

    <h2>Significance and Contribution</h2>
    <p>Cloud adoption in healthcare is constrained by strict regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, which alone don’t ensure security. As noted by Dumka & Sah (2019b), many frameworks are designed for enterprise IT and overlook the clinical, operational, and ethical realities of healthcare. The high interdependence among healthcare systems adds difficulty to standardising protocols. Ethical concerns like consent, data sovereignty, and surveillance further complicate security efforts. As argued by Shen et al. (2020), a purely technocentric approach risks overlooking usability and trust, leading to unintended consequences. This study aims to offer a more holistic, healthcare-specific understanding of cloud security risks.</p>

    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>What are the key security risks associated with cloud computing in healthcare, and how can these risks be mitigated through context-sensitive, ethically sound strategies?</p>

    <h2>Research Aims and Objectives</h2>
    <p>This study aims to critically evaluate security risks in healthcare cloud systems, particularly in hybrid environments. It seeks to identify common vulnerabilities, assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and explore the ethical and regulatory factors influencing outcomes. By analysing real-world incidents, including supply chain and persistent threats, it will assess the resilience of cloud infrastructures. The inclusion of stakeholder perspectives, such as IT professionals, clinicians, and data protection officers, ensures the relevance and practical value of the findings.</p>

    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
    <p>Hybrid cloud security is fragmented. As described by Almeida & Tavares (2021c), IAM gaps permit unauthorized access. Additionally, Al-Issa et al. (2019b) note divided responsibilities hinder accountability. As noted by Ferreira et al. (2018c), ransomware exploits unpatched systems. The 2024 Change Healthcare breach, according to Nemec Zlatolas et al. (2024), shows the impact of cloud interconnectivity.</p>
    <p>New threats like supply chain and AI-driven attacks emerge. As highlighted by Angelillo et al. (2023c), third-party code can bypass defences. According to Gorrepotu et al. (2018), IoT devices face firmware risks. Insider threats persist; Zhao et al. (2023c) explain privilege mismanagement is common. Dumka and Sah (2019c) stress least-privilege models and audit trails.</p>
    <p>Regulations lag behind innovation. As observed by Foorthuis (2020), many focus on checklists over real action. Shah et al. (2025) argue behavioural tools may infringe privacy. Additionally, Angelillo et al. (2023d) report staff resist intrusive controls. Effective and ethical security is needed.</p>

    <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
    <p>A secondary qualitative study draws from three UK healthcare cases. As suggested by Siripirote et al. (2020), purposive sampling supports diversity. Data sources include interviews, reports, and policies. Thematic analysis uses Braun and Clarke’s (2006) approach. Peer-reviewed and institutional sources are triangulated. Member checking, audit trails, and NHS ethical standards ensure rigour and confidentiality.</p>

    <h2>Ethics and Risk</h2>
    <p>Ethics follow the Declaration of Helsinki and UK data laws. As discussed in (PDF) Big Data Analytics (no date), behavioural monitoring may seem intrusive. Responses include anonymous feedback and third-party audits. Literature highlights sandboxing and fail-safes to reduce disruption.</p>

    <h2>Description of Artefacts</h2>
    <p>This study produces three artefacts based on thematic analysis. First, a risk taxonomy summarises common cloud vulnerabilities in healthcare, classified by severity, vector, and mitigation difficulty. Second, a qualitative evaluation framework blends technical, ethical, and operational criteria to assess cloud security. Finally, a policy guidance document offers recommendations on governance, regulation, training, and ethical surveillance. These artefacts aim to inform more comprehensive and responsible cloud practices in healthcare.</p>

    <h2>Proposed Timeline</h2>
    <p>The research is structured over eight months. The first month finalises the literature review and outlines ethical considerations. Months two and three are dedicated to data analysis. Months four through six focus on artefact development. In month seven, the artefacts are validated through cross-checking with existing standards. The final month is reserved for compiling the dissertation and making revisions based on feedback from peers and supervisors.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing presents both opportunities and risks in healthcare. While hybrid clouds enhance efficiency, they also create vulnerabilities that traditional models can’t fully address. As stated by Abouelmehdi, Beni-Hessane, and Khaloufi (2018), these risks span technical, systemic, and ethical dimensions. This study synthesises diverse secondary data to offer adaptable, security-conscious, and ethically grounded strategies for cloud adoption in healthcare. It contributes to a broader conversation about how to build secure, responsive, and trust-based digital infrastructures.</p>
