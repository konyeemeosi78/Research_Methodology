  <h1>Cloud Security Risks in the Healthcare Sector</h1>

  <p><strong>Presented by:</strong> Onyeemeosi Kingsley Oke</p>
  <p><strong>Programme:</strong> MSc Cyber Security, University of Essex</p>
  <p><strong>Module:</strong> Research Methodology</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, revolutionizing data storage, management, and service delivery. With the rise of digitized health records, telemedicine, and interconnected diagnostic tools, cloud services have enabled healthcare institutions to transcend traditional infrastructure limitations...</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>The increasing reliance on digital platforms in healthcare has elevated the importance of secure and reliable information systems. Cloud computing facilitates this by offering on-demand access to computing resources, scalable storage solutions, and cost-effective infrastructure...</p>

  <h2>Research Problem</h2>
  <p>Despite advancements in cybersecurity, cloud environments in healthcare still experience frequent breaches. These are not just technical failures but reflect deeper systemic problems...</p>

  <h2>Significance and Contribution</h2>
  <p>Cloud adoption in healthcare is constrained by strict regulations like HIPAA and GDPR, which alone don’t ensure security...</p>

  <h2>Research Question</h2>
  <p><em>What are the key security risks associated with cloud computing in healthcare, and how can these risks be mitigated through context-sensitive, ethically sound strategies?</em></p>

  <h2>Research Aims and Objectives</h2>
  <p>This study aims to critically evaluate security risks in healthcare cloud systems, particularly in hybrid environments...</p>

  <h2>Literature Review</h2>
  <p>Hybrid cloud security is fragmented. As described by Almeida & Tavares (2021c), IAM gaps permit unauthorized access...</p>

  <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
  <p>A secondary qualitative study draws from three UK healthcare cases. As suggested by Siripirote et al. (2020), purposive sampling supports diversity...</p>

  <h2>Ethics and Risk</h2>
  <p>Ethics follow the Declaration of Helsinki and UK data laws. As discussed in (PDF) Big Data Analytics… (no date), behavioural monitoring may seem intrusive...</p>

  <h2>Description of Artefacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A risk taxonomy summarises common cloud vulnerabilities in healthcare.</li>
    <li>A qualitative evaluation framework blends technical, ethical, and operational criteria.</li>
    <li>A policy guidance document offers governance, training, and ethical surveillance recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Proposed Timeline</h2>
  <p>The research is structured over eight months...</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Cloud computing presents both opportunities and risks in healthcare. While hybrid clouds enhance efficiency, they also create vulnerabilities that traditional models can’t fully address...</p>
