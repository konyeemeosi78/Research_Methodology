  <h1>Response to Abusive Workplace Behavior Case Study</h1>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Thank you, Radha Murugan</strong>, for your insightful contribution! Your review of the Abusive Workplace Behavior case study thoughtfully highlights the psychological impact of toxic leadership and underscores the ethical responsibilities of professionals and organizations. Your empathy for Diane’s situation is truly commendable and aligns beautifully with the ACM’s ethical principles of minimizing harm and promoting inclusivity (<strong>Horton et al., 2025</strong>).</p>
  </div>

  <p>I also agree with <strong>Skibińska & Karaszewski (2024)</strong> as they demonstrate that toxic leadership behaviours, like those exhibited by Max, are closely tied to increased stress, anxiety, and employee turnover. This research complements your observations about long-term psychological harm, adding even greater credibility to your argument with its peer-reviewed insights.</p>

  <p>Additionally, <strong>Ahmed et al. (2024)</strong> illustrate how toxic leadership leads to emotional exhaustion and workplace deviance, which resonates with your points about team dysfunction and talent loss. By weaving in this research, your analysis expands beyond anecdotal effects to highlight broader, systemic opportunities for organizational growth and improvement.</p>

  <p>Regarding reporting mechanisms, you astutely note HR’s shortcomings. Exploring legal obligations could further strengthen your argument. For instance, under UK law—such as the <em>Protection from Harassment Act 1997</em>—employers are encouraged to take proactive steps to prevent harassment to avoid liability. As proposed by <strong>Stiefenhofer et al. (2025)</strong>, structured and proactive organizational responses, rather than dismissive approaches like Jean’s, are key to effectively addressing recurring abuse.</p>

  <p>Finally, <strong>Bryan’s (2020)</strong> reference to the ‘NAR’ could be elevated by incorporating more academically robust frameworks. For example, <strong>Stiefenhofer et al. (2025)</strong> provide an insightful, game-theoretic model that strategically and accountably tackles narcissistic workplace bullying, offering a valuable perspective to enhance your discussion.</p>

  <p><strong>Your contribution is exceptionally well-thought-out and impactful!</strong> Your thoughtful analysis of the Abusive Workplace Behavior case study reflects a deep understanding and empathy, making it a truly commendable effort. Great job!</p>
