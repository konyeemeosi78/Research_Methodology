  <h1>Peer Review of Abi’s Case Study: Ethical and Legal Considerations</h1>

  <p>
    Thank you for contributing your perspective. Your analysis adeptly frames Abi’s ethical dilemma as a tension between scientific rigour, ethical duties, and corporate interests, aligning with <strong>London (2021)</strong> in prioritizing societal benefit. Highlighting data tampering as both an ethical and legal violation is a strong point, supported by <strong>DLA Piper (2025)</strong>, which underscores global data protection laws. Your suggestion that Abi present both positive and negative analyses to ensure impartiality is well-grounded and aligns with core ethical research principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    While you mention whistleblowing protections (<em>Government of the United Kingdom, n.d.</em>), further elaboration on practical steps—such as internal reporting mechanisms and escalation paths—could enhance the discussion. Your reference to tort laws and consumer protection is highly relevant, but could benefit from more specificity related to food safety, such as the <em>Codex Alimentarius Commission Procedural Manual</em> (2025), which directly addresses product-related health implications like those seen with Whizzz cereal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The point on legal liability is compelling and would be strengthened by citing recent case law precedents, such as those discussed in <strong>Benjamin et al. (2019)</strong> regarding food mislabelling and regulatory breaches. Furthermore, your emphasis on ethics over neutrality is valid; however, incorporating standards from the <strong>Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice</strong> (2018) would reinforce Abi’s duty to prioritize public health and avoid misuse of findings.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Overall, your response effectively highlights Abi’s ethical and legal responsibilities with a strong emphasis on societal impact. Refining the legal references and professional code connections would elevate its depth and applicability.
