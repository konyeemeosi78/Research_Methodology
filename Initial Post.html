    <h1>Accessibility in Software Development</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        In the ACM case study <em>Accessibility in Software Development</em> according to Horton et al. (2025), the software company AllTogether released a collaboration tool that lacked accessibility compliance due to project time constraints. This decision violated several principles in the ACM Code of Ethics, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The duty to contribute to society and human well-being (1.1)</li>
        <li>Avoid harm (1.2)</li>
        <li>Act fairly without discrimination (1.4)</li>
        <li>Uphold professional competence by respecting established rules (2.3)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These oversights excluded users with disabilities, undermining inclusive design principles essential to ethical software development.

      <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
      <p>
        From a legal perspective, neglecting accessibility measures exposes developers and companies to significant risk. In the United States, such non-compliance may breach the 
        <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, potentially resulting in litigation, fines, or loss of contracts. Likewise, the European Accessibility Act sets binding standards for digital accessibility across EU member states. These frameworks reinforce the idea that accessibility is a legal right, not an optional feature.

      <h2>Social and Ethical Dimensions</h2>
      <p>
        Socially, the exclusion of users with disabilities contributes to digital inequality and marginalization. It raises ethical concerns about the responsibilities of computing professionals to serve all users equitably. The team’s actions in this case reflected a lapse in integrity and professionalism, contrary to the expectations outlined in the ACM Code.

    <section>
      <h2>Professional Codes of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        The British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct supports similar values. It calls on members to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Act in the public interest (1a)</li>
        <li>Promote inclusive access to IT (1c)</li>
        <li>Comply with legislation and good practice (2b)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both codes emphasize that accessibility is not just a technical or legal issue, but a central element of ethical and professional responsibility.
