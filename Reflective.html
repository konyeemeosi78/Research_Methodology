    <h1>Reflective Piece</h1>
    <p>This reflection reviews my research methods, statistical analysis, and professional development within the context of studying Research Methods and Professional Practice Module focusing on cloud security risks in healthcare. Using Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model (What, So What, Now What), it evaluates key outcomes related to research design, skill development, and technical execution. Informed by various module components, the reflection highlights methodological flaws, technical gaps, and reactive strategies that affected overall effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>What: Description of Project Outcomes and Critical Incidents</h2>
    <p>The research methods process centred on a secondary qualitative study to investigate hybrid cloud security risks in healthcare, as outlined in the Literature Review and Research Proposal. Guid by Braun and Clarke (2019) I adopted a descriptive design using thematic analysis to synthesize secondary data from case studies like the NHS WannaCry attack and the 2021 HSE ransomware incident. This approach, however, failed to capture real-time stakeholder perspectives, revealing a methodological limitation. The Professional Skills Matrix identified strengths in communication, Java and Python programming, and teamwork, evidenced by leading an IoT software project, but exposed weaknesses in SQL, noSQL, and ethical decision-making. The SWOT Analysis revealed opportunities ( online learning platforms) and threats (rapid technological evolution), while the Action Plan set goals for achieving SQL and noSQL proficiency by early 2026. A critical incident occurred during a statistical analysis activity, where I misinterpreted requirements for converting Excel sheets into HTML tables for a GitHub Pages site, producing incomplete outputs and requiring multiple revisions</p>

    <h2>So What: Analysis and Interpretation of Outcomes</h2>
    <h3>Research Methods Process</h3>
    <p>The decision to use a secondary qualitative design, as informed by Pfeifer and Dolan (2023), was grounded in exploring the contextual 'how' and 'why' of cloud security risks, aligning with Sage’s (2021) emphasis on qualitative methods for interpreting complex phenomena. However, this choice proved flawed. Xin et al. (2017) argue that healthcare cybersecurity needs stakeholder-driven insights, which my reliance on secondary data such as ransomware case studies Schmidt et al. (2018) lacked. Without primary data like clinician interviews, the study couldn’t address concerns like patient trust and data sovereignty, as outlined in the Literature Review. The mixed-methods approach was employed to enhance generalizability; however, the narrow descriptive design omitted key metrics that could have bolstered the findings, as noted by (Al-Issa, Ottom and Tamrawi, 2019a). My ontological assumption of cloud risks as multifaceted was valid, but my ethical, value-driven focus led to a bias toward technical solutions and overlooked sociotechnical factors. Ethically, while anonymized data use aligned with the Declaration of Helsinki, it inadequately addressed patient-centric issues, as Xin et al. (2017b) emphasize.</p>

    <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
    <p>The statistical analysis activity exposed deficiencies in requirement analysis and technical execution. Misinterpreting the need for exact Excel-to-HTML replication led to incomplete outputs, a mistake often traced to inadequate stakeholder engagement, as shown by (Fernández et al., 2017a). My histogram used raw frequencies instead of relative ones, deviating from expectations, a flaw Wickham (2016) critiques in visualizations not using tools like ggplot2. I failed to anticipate user preferences for merged sheets or custom formatting, limiting adaptability, as ‘Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties’ (2021a) advocate for user-centric design. Although review identified these issues, my reactive corrections reflect a lack of proactive validation, as Krishna-Hensel (2018) deem essential for data projects. This incident highlighted gaps in precision and user engagement and misaligned the project with professional expectations.</p>

    <h3>Personal and Professional Development</h3>
    <p>The Professional Skills Matrix showed strengths in teamwork and programming, supporting industry needs for collaborative cybersecurity professionals (Wan et al., 2022a). However, my limited SQL and noSQL skills are a serious shortfall, given their role in managing healthcare cloud data (Al-Issa, Ottom and Tamrawi, 2019b). While the SWOT Analysis identified resources like Udemy, the Action Plan’s timeline (SQL by February,2026) appears unrealistic amid other commitments, as Schmidt et al. (2018b) highlight resource constraints in cybersecurity training. My ethical awareness, especially regarding GDPR, remains underdeveloped for handling dilemmas like algorithmic bias or patient consent undermining my ability to build trust in cloud security (Xin et al. (2017c). My leadership skills, though proficient, need enhancement to reach expert level, as Wan et al. (2022b) recommend for tech roles. The reactive nature of my skill-building, addressing gaps after discovery, shows poor foresight and calls for a more strategic approach.</p>

    <h2>Now What: Learning and Future Actions</h2>
    <h3>Research Methods Process</h3>
    <p>To improve, I will adopt a mixed-methods approach in future research, incorporating primary data such as interviews with clinicians to capture stakeholder perspectives. This will improve ethical depth and generalizability, especially around patient trust and consent (Xin et al., 2017d). I aim to refine thematic analysis using NVivo, as Sage (2021) recommends, to boost synthesis efficiency. Addressing literature gaps on long-term Zero Trust implementations, I will use case studies spanning years, ensuring relevance to healthcare, as suggested by (Al-Issa, Ottom and Tamrawi, 2019c). By March 2026, I plan to pilot a mixed-methods study.</p>

    <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
    <p>To improve technical skills, I will use tools like ggplot2, for accurate visuals such as relative frequencies. I will implement iterative requirement analysis, involving users early, as (Fernández et al., 2017b) advises. Proposing flexible solutions like navigation menus for HTML tables aligns with ‘Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties’ (2021b) user-centric approach. Regular peer reviews and validation checks will help avoid issues like truncated text. I aim to complete a data visualization course by December 2025 to strengthen these skills.</p>

    <h3>Personal and Professional Development</h3>
    <p>The Action Plan must be realistic. I’ll extend SQL and noSQL targets to July 2026 and adopt modular learning, following Schmidt et al. (2018c) guidance on sustainable upskilling. To enhance ethical awareness, I will attend a BCS ethics seminar by December 2025, focusing on healthcare dilemmas like algorithmic bias. Leadership development will involve mentorship from industry professionals by February 2026, building on my existing teamwork, as Wan et al. (2022c) advocate. Ongoing self-assessments using the Skills Matrix and quarterly reviews will monitor progress. I’ll also actively seek peer and supervisor feedback to pre-emptively address gaps and shift from a reactive stance.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This critical reflection highlights key flaws in my research methods, technical skills, and professional growth. Overreliance on secondary data, technical inaccuracies, and reactive learning approaches limit my effectiveness as a cybersecurity researcher. By embracing mixed methods, mastering visualization tools, adjusting timelines, and proactively tackling ethical and leadership gaps, I aim to develop a stronger, ethically aware, and professionally competent approach to addressing healthcare cloud security. These improvements will ensure alignment with academic and industry standards and foster a more strategic, forward-thinking mindset.</p>
