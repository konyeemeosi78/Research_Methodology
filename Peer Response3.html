  <h1>Feedback on Blocker Plus Case Study – Zhu Zhang</h1>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Thank you, Zhu Zhang</strong>. You offered a thoughtful and well-structured evaluation of the <em>Blocker Plus</em> case study, effectively highlighting the ethical complexities surrounding machine learning applications in public systems. The integration of both the ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct lends credibility to the analysis and demonstrates a sound understanding of professional responsibilities in computing.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Positively, you successfully underscore the discriminatory outcomes of algorithmic bias and link this to Principles <strong>1.2</strong> and <strong>1.4</strong> of the ACM Code, which address harm and fairness (<strong>ACM, 2018</strong>). This focus on how biased data impacts marginalised groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, reflects a nuanced appreciation of broader societal risks. According to <strong>Peters (2022)</strong>, algorithmic bias not only skews representation but also undermines democratic discourse—an argument Zhu rightly incorporates.</p>

  <p>Moreover, your use of <strong>Amoore (2023)</strong> adds depth, especially in highlighting how control over machine learning parameters carries both technical and ethical significance. This is a vital point that strengthens the critique of Blocker Plus’s failure to maintain transparency and public accountability.</p>

  <p>Your response is thoughtful and engaging, and it could be further enriched by incorporating clearer references to the <strong>BCS Code of Conduct</strong> to fully address the comparative element outlined in the task. For example, highlighting Principle 3 on <em>Public Interest</em> from the BCS code (<strong>BCS, 2023</strong>), which emphasizes inclusivity and transparency, would beautifully complement your analysis.</p>

  <p><strong>In summary</strong>, your analysis is commendable for its clarity and ethical sensitivity.</p>
