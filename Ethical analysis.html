    <h1>Ethical Analysis of the Case Study</h1>

    <p>When Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he is still ethically obliged to protect individuals' privacy and adhere to institutional protocols. As highlighted by Ethics Guidelines (n.d.), all personnel handling sensitive health or administrative data are expected to respect confidentiality and avoid any action that could compromise individual privacy. Releasing identifiable information without proper authorization or ethical approval violates both ethical norms and likely legal standards. According to Ploug (2020), informed consent is fundamental in research ethics, especially when dealing with identifiable data. In this scenario, Ricardo lacks both the authority and ethical justification to release personal details.</p>

    <p>If Ricardo were responsible for determining access, his ethical obligations would be more complex but still constrained by fundamental research ethics principles. As outlined in The Belmont Report | HHS.gov (no date), the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice must inform decisions involving human subjects. Ricardo would need to weigh the potential societal benefit of Beth’s research against the privacy risks to individuals. Without prior consent or independent ethical oversight (e.g., Institutional Review Board approval), releasing names and addresses would likely contravene best practices. Furthermore, Ricardo would need to consider whether Beth’s intended use aligns with the scope of the original data collection and individuals’ expectations of how their data would be used.</p>

    <p>Beth’s desire to contact individuals also raises ethical concerns. Direct contact based on records data requires informed consent and careful consideration of privacy. As observed by Ploug (2020), any re-identification of anonymised data for secondary use without consent undermines individual autonomy. Even if the purpose is research, contacting individuals without their prior agreement constitutes an ethical breach. According to Shah, Lovelace and Mays (2012a), researchers must adopt procedures that respect data subjects' rights and seek appropriate approvals when dealing with personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p>The Records Department faces a crucial decision in determining whether releasing names to a researcher is appropriate. As highlighted by Shah, Lovelace and Mays (2012b), public institutions managing data must ensure that any disclosure adheres to ethical norms, legal standards, and community trust. The department must consider whether individuals have provided consent, whether the data use serves a public good, and whether the research is conducted under valid ethical governance structures.</p>

    <p>If Beth receives a mixed set of responses—some consenting, some refusing, and others remaining silent—she encounters both ethical and methodological challenges. She cannot treat non-responses as implicit consent, as this would undermine the integrity of informed participation. To proceed ethically, she may consider following up with non-respondents only if they were informed that further contact might occur. Otherwise, she may need to revise her research approach to include only those who clearly consented or seek further ethical guidance on how to proceed.</p>
