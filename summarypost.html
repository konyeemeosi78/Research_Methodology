    <h1>Summary Post</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>AllTogether case study</strong>, as analysed by Horton et al. (2025), reveals critical ethical and professional shortcomings in software development when accessibility is neglected. The release of an inaccessible collaboration tool, driven by time constraints, contravened key principles of the <strong>ACM Code of Ethics</strong>, notably the obligations to contribute to human well-being (Principle 1.1), avoid harm (Principle 1.2), ensure fairness (Principle 1.4), and respect professional standards (Principle 2.3).
    </p>
    <p>
      As observed by Horton et al. (2025a), prioritizing launch schedules over accessibility excluded users with disabilities, undermining inclusive design and exposing the company to reputational and operational risks. This decision reflects a failure to uphold professional competence and ethical responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legally</strong>, non-compliance with accessibility standards, such as the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> and Section 508, risks litigation and financial penalties. Similarly, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Accessibility Act</a> mandates digital accessibility, reinforcing accessibility as a legal imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Socially</strong>, the exclusion of disabled users perpetuates digital inequality, raising ethical concerns about equitable access to technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparatively, the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCS Code of Conduct</a> emphasizes public interest (1a), inclusive access (1c), and legal compliance (2b), aligning with ACM’s principles. Both codes underscore accessibility as a cornerstone of ethical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      AllTogether’s partial mitigation through transparency and customer support, as noted by Horton et al. (2025b), is commendable but insufficient. Proactive adherence to accessibility standards during development could have prevented harm, reduced costs, and enhanced professional integrity.
