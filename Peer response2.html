  <h1>Peer Review of Abi’s Case Study: Accuracy of Information</h1>

  <p>
    Thanks for sharing such insightful thoughts. Your analysis effectively underscores Abi’s ethical obligations, emphasizing data integrity and the risks of selective reporting, as supported by the <em>BPS Code of Human Research Ethics</em> (2021). Highlighting that emphasizing only favorable analyses constitutes ethical manipulation is a strong point, aligning with <strong>Ferrara (2024)</strong>, who stresses transparency and outcome consideration. Your call for Abi to disclose both positive and negative findings with methodological context is well-grounded and promotes scientific integrity.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the application of the <strong>Declaration of Helsinki</strong> is slightly overstated, as it primarily applies to medical research. A more relevant framework specific to consumer product research could better address concerns for a cereal like Whizzz.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, while you suggest practical steps like including a disclaimer or negotiating publication terms, these could be expanded with guidance from professional codes. The <strong>Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice</strong> (2018) emphasizes that proactive communication can prevent misuse of findings, which would further strengthen your practical recommendations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your discussion of legal implications, supported by <strong>Ghapa and Ab Kadir (2021)</strong>, correctly notes potential breaches of consumer protection laws. However, citing specific regulations—such as food labelling standards—would enhance the legal depth. The mention of whistleblowing is apt, but providing more detail on Abi’s legal protections would strengthen this point.
  </p>

  <p>
    Socially, your argument about eroding public trust is compelling. Still, further elaboration on the broader societal impact of research misconduct—particularly regarding vulnerable populations like children—would enhance your case and highlight the ethical stakes involved.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Overall, your response robustly addresses Abi’s ethical and professional responsibilities with strong academic support. Refining the applicability of frameworks and expanding on practical and legal protections would enhance its depth.
