  <h1>Excel Worksheet - Diets</h1>

3. **Test Your Site**:
   - Visit `https://username.github.io/diets.html` (or `index.html` if you used that file) to see the table displayed like your Excel sheet.
   - The table will show all 101 rows and 8 columns, with headers, weight loss data, summary statistics, and the interpretation text, styled to resemble Excel’s grid layout.

### Notes
- **Formatting**: The HTML replicates Excel’s default style with light gray headers and alternating row colors. If your Excel sheet has specific formatting (e.g., cell colors, bold text, or font sizes), let me know, and I can adjust the CSS.
- **Accessibility**: The table uses proper `<th>` and `<td>` tags for screen reader compatibility. The interpretation text in H30 is styled to fit within the table cell. If you need additional accessibility features (e.g., ARIA attributes), I can add them.
- **Data Accuracy**: I’ve included all data exactly as provided, including numerical precision (e.g., `5.341199999999999`) and the interpretation text. Note that the Diet B sample size is listed as 49 in row 23 but has 50 entries (rows 52–101); I followed the data as provided. If this is an error, let me know to correct it.
- **Empty Sheets**: "Sheet2" and "Sheet3" were empty in the provided data. If you have content for these sheets or want placeholders (e.g., empty tables with their names), please provide details.
- **Multiple Sheets**: Since you mentioned three more sheets, this is the first. Please share the data for the remaining two sheets, and specify if you want them in separate HTML files (e.g., `sheet2.html`, `sheet3.html`) or combined into one file with multiple tables (e.g., in `index.html` with separate sections). If combining, I can add navigation or tabs to switch between sheets.

### Next Steps
- Please share the data for the remaining two sheets (e.g., as text like this or via a file upload/link). If they’re in separate Excel files or sheets within "Exe 8.1B Work sheet.xlsx" (e.g., "Sheet2" and "Sheet3" with actual data), provide their content.
- Confirm your preference for file structure: one HTML file with all sheets or separate files for each.
- If you want to host the original Excel file for download, I can guide you on adding a download link (e.g., upload to your repository and link via `<a href="path/to/Exe 8.1B Work sheet.xlsx">Download Excel File</a>`).

Let me know the details for the next two sheets or any tweaks needed for this one! Glad you’re impressed—let’s make the next ones just as fantastic!
