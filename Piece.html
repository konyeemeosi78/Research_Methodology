Feedback on my literature review outline was particularly valuable, encouraging me to refine and improve my work through iterative reflection.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, these units shifted my understanding of research from a set of isolated techniques to a thoughtful, ethical, and adaptive process. They enhanced my ability to think critically, engage constructively with peers, and apply research skills in real-world computing contexts.</p>
    
    <p>Going forward, I plan to apply structured frameworks for research planning, integrate mixed methods for well-rounded analysis, and use reflection through my e-Portfolio to track growth. These skills will support my aim to contribute meaningfully to the computing field with research that is ethical, inclusive, and impactful.</p>
    
    <p>Units 5, 6, and 7 significantly expanded my understanding of data collection and quantitative analysis, which are essential for conducting research in computing. In Unit 5, I explored interviews, surveys, and questionnaire design, and reflected in my e-Portfolio on appropriate data collection tools for my research area. Unit 6 introduced quantitative methods, focusing on levels of measurement and descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, and measures of spread. Unit 7 built on this foundation by covering inferential statistics, including probability and hypothesis testing. I applied these concepts using Excel in a worksheet, which helped me interpret data and draw meaningful conclusions. Together, these units developed my ability to conduct structured, data-driven research.</p>
    
    <p>Engaging with the content was both challenging and transformative. In Unit 5, designing a questionnaire required careful attention to clarity and neutrality to avoid introducing bias. While I was comfortable with survey methods, this task deepened my appreciation for the precision needed in crafting effective research instruments. Unit 6 was intellectually demanding, despite my background in mathematics. Applying statistical measures to real data improved my analytical thinking and gave me practical tools for interpreting computing performance. In Unit 7, I initially struggled with understanding probability and interpreting p-values, but working through the worksheet brought clarity and a sense of accomplishment. These experiences helped me develop greater confidence, patience, and attention to detail.</p>
    
    <p>Looking ahead, I plan to apply these skills in academic projects and professional computing contexts. I will design reliable surveys for tasks like software usability testing, use descriptive statistics to assess system performance, and apply hypothesis testing to evaluate outcomes in computing experiments. Regular reflection through my e-Portfolio will support continued growth, ensuring my research remains rigorous, ethical, and relevant to real-world computing challenges.</p>
    
    <p>Units 8 to 10 deepened my ability to analyze, validate, and communicate research findings, skills essential for impactful computing work. In Unit 8, I practiced both qualitative and quantitative analysis by completing a detailed Charts worksheet, selecting appropriate graphs for different data types, and critiquing three peers’ Unit 7 analyses. I then documented my reflections and visualizations in my e-Portfolio. Unit 9 shifted focus to research credibility, exploring validity, generalisability, and reliability through a structured worksheet and by summarizing our Unit 7 forum discussions. My e-Portfolio update captured how these concepts underpin trustworthy results. Finally, Unit 10 guided me through the architecture of a dissertation and the components of a strong research proposal, culminating in an audio narrated slide deck and full transcript outlining my presentation.</p>
    
    <p>Engaging with these units was both demanding and rewarding. Selecting chart formats in Unit 8 initially felt daunting, as plotting charts with required dimensions tested my judgment, but comparing my approach with the module’s examples guided me and boosted my confidence. Unit 9’s emphasis on ensuring that results truly reflect underlying phenomena challenged me to think critically about sampling methods and measurement tools. Working through the worksheet clarified how to guard against bias and bolster generalisability. Preparing the Unit 10 presentation pushed me outside my comfort zone: scripting and narrating a formal proposal forced me to distil complex ideas into clear, persuasive narratives, strengthening my oral and written communication skills.</p>
