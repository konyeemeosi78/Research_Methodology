  <h1>Summary Post: Case Study – Accuracy of Information</h1>

  <p>
    The ethical dilemma faced by Abi in reporting research on Whizzz cereal highlights core concerns around statistical integrity, professional responsibility, and public safety. The initial post stressed that although Abi did not fabricate data, selectively presenting only positive findings undermines ethical standards and could mislead stakeholders. Transparency is essential, especially when public health is involved, as highlighted by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/JOURNAL.PMED.0020124" target="_blank">Ioannidis (2005)</a>.
  </p>

    I agree with Stephanie, who expanded this by contextualising the issue within a broader erosion of public trust in science. She argued that even methodologically sound yet selectively communicated results can foster perceptions of bias, ultimately damaging institutional credibility, as discussed in <em>Science Fictions: How Fraud, Bias, Negligence, and Hype Undermine the Search for Truth</em> (2020). Citing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3731725" target="_blank">Horton et al. (2025)</a>, she emphasised that professionals must avoid misrepresentation and ensure their work cannot be used deceptively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rodrigo brought in the global regulatory dimension, noting that many countries suffer from fragmented food safety systems. He warned that if Abi conceals harmful findings, he could face legal consequences alongside the manufacturer under frameworks such as those enforced by the EFSA and UK Food Standards Agency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fahad added that beyond legality, Abi has a moral duty to disclose all results. Drawing from healthcare ethics, he argued that silence in the face of potential harm equates to complicity. Publishing the full report or consulting an ethics committee were presented as responsible alternatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, contributors agreed that Abi must prioritise transparency and public interest. Selective reporting may offer short-term corporate gains but risks legal action, professional damage, and broader harm to public trust in science.
