        <p>Thank you very much for submitting your formative Research presentation proposal on time.</p>
        <p>The content is focused, you have clearly done your research and your intentions for the summative are well outlined. Noted you have discussed primary research and just to mention this will need to be applied to your Capstone project but not for this summative as part of this module, as we are using secondary research only.</p>
        <p>If your subject is similar to your Literature Review, you need to make sure that you engage in research/discussion that comes from a completely different angle than your Literature Review to avoid self-plagiarism. You have to ‘build’ upon the subject from the Literature Review and not merely just re-interpret the subject.</p>
        <p>I look forward to your summative submission, in the meantime please reflect on all of the above and the very best of luck for the summative itself.</p>
